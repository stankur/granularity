This is a demo of an interface to get a bigger picture understanding of long texts.

My approach is to use topic-aware recursive summarization to progressively make the text shorter.

So, when you are reading a paragraph, the tool knows which neighboring paragraphs belong to the same topic. Then, you could control the granularity level of that topic. Switching between granularity levels is smooth so that as you are reading, you could switch back and forth between granularity levels with ease.

Other "controllable granularity level" interfaces which seem to touch a similar idea to mine:
